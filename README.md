# PlexNFClistener-DAP

This project is a simple Digital Audio Player that gives us a similar feel of a Vinyl player. This is designed keeping in mind to use very less resources of Raspberry Pi. infact, most of the code is written for Raspberry Pi 3A+ with no XServer or desktop. This project uses the power of Framebuffer in Linux. 

* What it is built on?
  Raspberry Pi 3A+,
  PN532 RFID Module (Via I2C connection).
  
  Optional: Waveshare 4.3 inch DSI display, to see Album art and basic track info. If nothing's playing--then it works as a digital clock, by fetching today's Bing Wallpaper as background.
  
* I do not have PN532 module, can I still run it as just a desktop show and tell display?
  Yes, you can use it as Desktop show and tell type device. Whatever is running on the headless pi is displayed on the screen.

* What is needed in .env file? And where should I create one?
  Create it in the folder you are running main.py from. For example,
  ```
  sudo nano /home/pi/plexdap/.env
  ```
  .emv file needs to have these below mwntioned variables.
  - Open weather API key is for displaying Weather information. You can get a free API key in Openweather≈õ website.
  - LAT and LON are your Latitude and Longitude, which are used to fetch weather information of your exact location.
  - Else, it could get information from CITY information also
  - PLEX Token can be easy to get if you follow this: https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/

```
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="openweatherapikey"
LAT=yourlatitude
LON=yourlongitude
CITY=yourcity
PLEX_TOKEN="yourplextoken"
PLEX_URL="http://[plexserver_ip_address]:32400/status/sessions/?X-Plex-Token=yourplextoken"
PLEX_BASE_URL="http://[plexserver_ip_address]:32400"
```

* How to run it?
  As Raspberry Pi OS comes with Python3, it is as simple as creating a systemctl service to run on the startup.

```
  sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/dap.service 
  ```
  Paste this in the service file


```
  
[Unit]
Description=Master Code for NFC and Plexamp Art Display
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 10
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/plexdap/main.py
Restart=on-failure
User=jay
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/plexdap
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target



```
  Give permissions to main.py, and run the service.

```
chmod +x /home/pi/plexdap/main.py

sudo systemctl enable dap.service

sudo systemctl start dap.service

sudo systemctl status dap.service
```

Any thing else recommended?
I recommend running this in a Python virtual environment. Please check main.py, I've used .venv as virtual environment, atleast for running nfc script. Make sure you have all packages installed.
