# PlexNFClistener-DAP

This project is a simple Digital Audio Player that gives us a similar feel of a Vinyl player. This is designed keeping in mind to use very less resources of Raspberry Pi. infact, most of the code is written for Raspberry Pi 3A+ with no XServer or desktop. This project uses the power of Framebuffer in Linux. 

* What it is built on?
  Raspberry Pi 3A+, PN532 RFID Module (Via I2C connection).
  Optional: Waveshare 4.3 inch DSI display, to see Album art and basic track info. If nothing's playing--then it works as a digital clock.
