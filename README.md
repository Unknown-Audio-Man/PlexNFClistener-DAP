# PlexNFClistener-DAP

This project is a simple Digital Audio Player that gives us a similar feel of a Vinyl player. This is designed keeping in mind to use very less resources of Raspberry Pi. infact, most of the code is written for Raspberry Pi 3A+ with no XServer or desktop. This project uses the power of Framebuffer in Linux.
